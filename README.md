# aeServerTimers

For AstroEmpires game..

Replaces local end of event times with server time.

I'm far from a JS developer, it's probably spaghetti code, but it seems to work. 

Requires either Firefox with Greasemonkey, or Chrome with Tampermonkey.
Install whichever userscript for the browser you are using.
