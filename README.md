# aeServerTimers

For AstroEmpires game..

Replaces local end of event times with server time.

I'm far from a JS developer, it's probably spaghetti code, but it seems to work. 

Requires either Firefox with Greasemonkey, or Chrome / Safari  with Tampermonkey.
Install whichever userscript for the browser you are using.
Make sure you have skin set to Dark Astros, and you have 

 Display animated server time. ENABLED
 
 Display animated local time. ENABLED
 
 Display end times of events (in local time). DISABLED

In the future I will be updating it so it should work regardless of the options.
